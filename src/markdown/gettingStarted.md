# Getting started

## Introduction
The Annex 75 Calculation Tool (A75CT) was developed as part of the IEA EBC Annex 75 project entitled "Cost-effective Building Renovation at District Level Combining Energy Efficiency & Renewables". The purpose of the tool is to conceptualise a calculation framework for optimising cost and environmental impact of building renovation measures and district energy supply systems.

The tool is developed by StruSoft AB with input from project participants of the Annex.

### Delimitations
Currently, the A75CT allows the calculation of energy systems for heating combined with renovation measures intended to reduce the energy use.

### Prerequisites
To use the A75CT, some data needs to be retrieved in advance, whether through calculations or through the collection of references:

* Building energy needs for the entire district, regarding space heating and domestic hot water
  * Annual energy need in kWh/a]
  * This can be simulated using dynamic or static whole building modelling software
* Domestic electricity consumption (lighting and appliances)
  * Annual energy need in $[kWh/a]$
  * This can be simulated using dynamic or static whole building modelling software or retrieved from applicable standards
* Calculation details regarding district systems and renewable energy sources
* Life cycle cost/impact data
  * Investment and maintenance cost, environmental impact, and life span of energy system equipment as a function of system size
  * Investment and maintenance cost, environmental impact, and life span of renovation measures as a function of amount of installed material/equipment

### Output
The output of the tool is the key performance indicators specific annual primary energy use [kWh/m$^2$,a], specific annualised cost [â‚¬/m$^2$,a] and specific annualised carbon emissions [kg CO$_2$eq/m$^2$,a] for any number of scenarios combining energy system options and renovation measures.
