# Getting started

## Introduction
The Annex 75 Calculation Tool (A75CT) was developed as part of the IEA EBC Annex 75 project entitled "Cost-effective Building Renovation at District Level Combining Energy Efficiency & Renewables". The purpose of the tool is to conceptualise a calculation framework for optimising cost and environmental impact of building renovation measures and district energy supply systems.

The tool is developed by StruSoft AB with input from project participants of the Annex.

### Delimitations
Currently, the A75CT allows the calculation of energy systems for heating combined with renovation measures intended to reduce the energy use.

### Prerequisites
To use the A75CT, some data needs to be retrieved in advance, whether through calculations or through the collection of references:

* Building energy needs for the entire district, regarding space heating
* Building energy needs for the entire district, regarding the provision of domestic hot water
* Domestic electricity consumption (ligHing and appliances)
* Calculation details regarding district systems and renewable energy sources (costs as a function of system size)

### Output
The output of the tool is the key performance indicators specific annual primary energy use [kWh/m$^2$,a], specific annualised cost [â‚¬/m$^2$,a] and specific annualised carbon emissions [kg CO$_2$eq/m$^2$,a] for any number of scenarios combining energy system options and renovation measures.
